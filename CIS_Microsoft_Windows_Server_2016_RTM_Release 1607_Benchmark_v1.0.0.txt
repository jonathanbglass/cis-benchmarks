Overview
This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for Microsoft Windows ServerTo obtain the latest version of this guide, please
visit http://benchmarks.cisecurity.orgIf you have questions, comments, or have identified
ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org.

Intended Audience
This document is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,
auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy,
assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Microsoft Windows Server.

Consensus Guidance
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter expertsConsensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus reviewThe first phase occurs
during initial benchmark developmentDuring this phase, subject matter experts convene
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmarkThis discussion occurs until
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendationsThe second phase begins
after the benchmark has been publishedDuring this phase, all feedback provided by the
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the
benchmarkIf you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit
https://community.cisecurity.org.

Recommendations
1 Account Policies
This section contains recommendations for account policies.

1.1 Password Policy
This section contains recommendations for password policy.

1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more
password(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be
associated with a user account before you can reuse an old passwordThe value for this
policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwordsThe default value for Windows Vista is
0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwordsTo maintain the
effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users
from repeatedly changing their password.
The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).


Rationale:
The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can
determine the password through brute force attacksAlso, any accounts that may have
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchangedIf
password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually
reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly
reduced.
If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small
number of passwords repeatedlyIf you do not also configure the Minimum password age
setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original
password.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or
more password(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Enforce password history

Impact:
The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time
they are required to change their old oneIf users are required to change their passwords
to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords
somewhere so that they do not forget themAnother risk is that users may create
passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on)
to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guessAlso, an excessively low value for
the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because
users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.
Default Value:
24 passwords remembered on domain members0 passwords remembered on stand-alone
servers.

This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.
Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 daysIf you set the value to 0, the
password will never expire.
Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the
less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked passwordHowever, the lower this value
is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users
having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
The recommended state for this setting is 60 or fewer days, but not 0.
Rationale:
The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a
brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user
sharing the passwordConfiguring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users
are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a
compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user is
authorized access.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 60 or
fewer days, but not 0:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Maximum password age


Impact:
If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their
passwords very oftenSuch a configuration can reduce security in the organization,
because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose themIf the value
for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to
use compromised accounts.
Default Value:
42 days.

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before
you can change itThe range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days.
(You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value
for this setting is 0 days.
The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s).
Rationale:
Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to
remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise.
Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific
individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old
passwords can cause a security breachTo address password reuse a combination of
security settings is requiredUsing this policy setting with the Enforce password history
setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwordsFor example, if you configure the Enforce
password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords,
they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they
started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that
is greater than 0You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than
for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more
character(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for
a user accountThere are many different theories about how to determine the best
password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a better term than
"password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can
include spacesTherefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass
phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random
numbers and letters, and yet is easier to rememberUsers must be educated about the
proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length.
In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is
characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business
requirements.
The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).
Rationale:
Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words
and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters).
Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to
discover the accounts and passwords.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.


Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or
more character(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password length

Impact:
Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose itIf
very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and
increase the volume of help desk callsIf your organization has issues with forgotten
passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass
phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character
combinations, much harder to discover.
Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support
passwords that are longer than 14 charactersComputers that run these older operating
systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that
require long passwords.
Default Value:
7 characters on domain members0 characters on stand-alone servers.

1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set
to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements
for strong passwords.
When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two
consecutive characters - Be at least six characters in length - Contain characters from three
of the following four categories: - English uppercase characters (A through Z) - English
lowercase characters (a through z) - Base 10 digits (0 through 9) - Non-alphabetic
characters (for example, !, $, #, %) - A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does
not fall under the previous four categoriesThis fifth category can be regionally specific.
Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentiallyFor
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have
(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinationsAt 1,000,000 attempts per
second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes
to crackA seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has
combinationsA seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without
punctuation has 627 combinationsAn eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011)
possible combinationsAlthough this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000
attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwordsRemember,
these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other
special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@"Proper use of the password settings can
help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with
several publicly available tools.


Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements

Impact:
If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for
locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that
contain non-alphabetic charactersHowever, all users should be able to comply with the
complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.
If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom
version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength
rulesFor example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row
characters(Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key
and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform
a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common
dictionary words or fragments.
Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a
passwordHowever, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users
and an extremely busy help deskAlternatively, your organization could consider a
requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 01280159 range.
(ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that
would not add additional complexity to the password.)
Default Value:
Enabled on domain membersDisabled on stand-alone servers.

This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way
that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that
require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposesPasswords that are
stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the

1.2 Account Lockout Policy
This section contains recommendations for account lockout policy.

1.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more
minute(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is
unlocked and a user can try to log on againThe setting does this by specifying the number
of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailableIf the value for this policy setting
is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator
manually unlocks them.
Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a
high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk
receives to unlock accounts locked by mistakeUsers should be aware of the length of time
a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have
an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
Rationale:
A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout
threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific accountOnce you configure the
Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number
of failed attemptsIf you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the
account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 15 or
more minute(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account

Impact:
Although it may seem like a good idea to configure this policy setting to never
automatically unlock an account, such a configuration can increase the number of requests
that your organization's help desk receives to unlock accounts that were locked by mistake.
Default Value:
None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is

Description:
This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is

the account lockout threshold.
The recommended state for this setting is: 10 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but
not 0.
Rationale:
Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password brute
force attack will be successfulSetting the account lockout threshold too low introduces
risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally locking out
accounts.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Account lockout threshold


Impact:
If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an
administrator or until the account lockout duration expiresThis setting may generate
additional help desk calls.
If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by
deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure
the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value.
If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's
attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a
robust audit mechanism is not in place.

Description:
This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold
resets to zeroThe default value for this policy setting is Not DefinedIf the Account lockout
threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account
lockout duration setting.
If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that
is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attackAn attacker could
maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization,
which will lock out their accountsIf no policy were determined to reset the account
lockout, it would be a manual task for administratorsConversely, if a reasonable time
value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until
all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.
The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
Rationale:
Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password
multiple timesTo reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout
counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the
counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.

Impact:
If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is
too long, a DoS attack could occurAn attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to each
user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the preceding
paragraphsIf you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after setting,
administrators would have to manually unlock all accountsIf you configure this policy
setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which

Rationale:
Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target
computers for which they have permissionFor example, the Access this computer from the
network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and foldersIf this
user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone in the group will be able to read
the files in those shared foldersHowever, this situation is unlikely for new installations of
Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS
permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone groupThis vulnerability
may have a higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to a specific
domainFor this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the
Default Domain Controller Policy for the domainA user who has been assigned this right
can add up to 10 workstations to the domainUsers who have been assigned the Create
Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can
add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether they have
been assigned the Add workstations to a domain user rightBy default, all users in the
Authenticated Users group have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active
Directory domainThese new computer accounts are created in the Computers container.
In Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or
computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources.
In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the
ability to authenticate and access domain resourcesHowever, some organizations may
want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
consistently track, build, and manage the computersIf users are allowed to add computers
to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hamperedAlso, users could
perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create
additional unauthorized domain computers.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
The Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerabilityUsers with
this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates
organizational security policiesFor example, if your organization does not want its users
to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could install Windows on his
or her computer and then add the computer to the domainThe user would know the
password for the local administrator account, and could log on with that account and then
add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.

2.2.9 (L1) Ensure 'Change the system time' is set to 'Administrators,
LOCAL SERVICE' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the
internal clock of the computers in your environmentUsers who are assigned this user right
can affect the appearance of event logsWhen a computer's time setting is changed, logged
events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.
When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts.
Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or
computers.
Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers
in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which
could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access
domain resources after they are logged onAlso, problems will occur when Group Policy is
applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain
controllers.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.


Rationale:
Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problemsFor example,
time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders
that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain
may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from
themAlso, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and
authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period,
an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain
or grant Kerberos tickets.
The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers, member
servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically
synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following ways:





All client desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating domain
controller as their inbound time partner.
All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
All PDC emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the
selection of their inbound time partner.
The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for
the organizationTherefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to
synchronize with a reliable external time server.

This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system
time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time
server that is not accurate.

prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE:

Impact:
There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be
fully automated for all computers that belong to the domainComputers that do not belong
to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.
Rationale:
A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can
lead to the system being compromisedIt is highly recommended that you do not assign
any user accounts this right.
The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's
privilegesAccess tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a
remote computer over a networkWhen you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately
recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the
user logs on or connectsUsers with the ability to create or modify tokens can change the

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic linksIn Windows Vista,
existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a
new kind of file system object called a symbolic linkA symbolic link is a pointer (much like
a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or
another symbolic linkThe difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a
shortcut only works from within the Windows shellTo other programs and applications,
shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is
implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not
designed to use themFor this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only
be assigned to trusted usersBy default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.

to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical
operating system componentsDevelopers who are debugging their own applications do
not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new
system components will need it.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information
from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structuresSome attack
tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security
information, or to insert rootkit codeBy default, the Debug programs user right is assigned
only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.

Impact:
If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programsHowever, typical
circumstances rarely require this capability on production computersIf a problem arises
that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the
server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a
separate Group Policy for that OU.
The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs privilege;
if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will failFor additional information about how to
configure Windows Clustering in conjunction with computer hardening, see Microsoft

denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer unavailable to service
user requestsTherefore, it is recommended that only highly trusted administrators be
assigned this user right.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
Any user who can shut down a computer could cause a DoS condition to occurTherefore,
this user right should be tightly restricted.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users or processes can generate audit records in the
Security log.
The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE.
Note: A Member Server that holds the Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Server Role Service
will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application pool(s) to
be granted this user right.

require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow the NT SERVICE\ADFSSrv and
NT SERVICE\DRS services, as well as the associated Active Directory Federation Services
service account, to be granted this user right.
Rationale:
An attacker could use this capability to create a large number of audited events, which
would make it more difficult for a system administrator to locate any illicit activityAlso, if
the event log is configured to overwrite events as needed, any evidence of unauthorized
activities could be overwritten by a large number of unrelated events.

2.2.25 (L1) Configure 'Impersonate a client after authentication' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or
another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the userIf this user right is
required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a
client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a
service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the
unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.
Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group
added by default to their access tokensCOM servers that are started by the COM
infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group
added to their access tokensAs a result, these processes are assigned this user right when
they are started.
Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist: - The
access token that is being impersonated is for this user- The user, in this logon session,
logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token- The
requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.
An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client
to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

Note: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server and its optional "Integration Services"
component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional
SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.


Rationale:
An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client
to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

2.3.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Administrator account status' is set to
'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting enables or disables the Administrator account during normal operation.
When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled,
regardless of how this setting is configuredNote that this setting will have no impact when
applied to the domain controller organizational unit via group policy because domain
controllers have no local account databaseIt can be configured at the domain level via
group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular
schedule for periodic password changes for local accountsTherefore, you may want to
disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes
to protect it from attackAnother reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be
locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Accounts: Administrator account status

Impact:
Maintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the Administrator
accountFor example, if the secure channel between a member computer and the domain
controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no other local
Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that broke the
secure channel.
If the current Administrator password does not meet the password requirements, you will
not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabledIf this situation
occurs, another member of the Administrators group must set the password on the
Administrator account with the Local Users and Groups tool.
Default Value:
Disabled.

Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the domain controller
organizational unit via group policy because domain controllers have no local account

lockout and password policy settings.
Rationale:
The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no
passwordThese unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the
Guest account over the networkThis capability means that any network shares with
permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone

Rationale:
Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden
through both organizational policy and suitable technical measuresIn fact, the default
settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven
charactersHowever, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domainbased password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwordsFor example, a
user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank
passwords, and then join the computer to the domainThe local accounts with blank
passwords would still functionAnyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will
targetIt is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that
denote administrative or elevated access accountsBe sure to also change the default
description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console)On
Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the
built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created.
Rationale:
The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or later
operating systemsIf you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized
persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.
The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an
attacker might use a bad passwordThis capability makes the Administrator account a
popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwordsThe value of this
countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are
third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name.
Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute
force attack by using the SID to log on.

This section contains recommendations related to auditing controls.

2.3.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings
(Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings' is set
to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities
present in Windows Vista.
The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet
contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategoriesTo properly apply the
auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory
settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to
be configured to Enabled.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Important: Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of
trafficFor example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege
Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find
other types of entries in the Security logSuch a configuration could also have a significant
impact on system performance.
Rationale:
Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to
track events at a per-system or per-user levelThe larger event categories created too
many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.

normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.


2.3.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to
log security audits' is set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security
eventsIt is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2
and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit
system is unable to log themMicrosoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the
system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failureWhen
this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be
logged for any reason.
If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is
enabled, unplanned system failures can occurThe administrative burden can be
significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do
not overwrite events (clear log manually)This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a
backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of
service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is
overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security
logAlso, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the
operating system, applications, or data could resultAlthough the NTFS file system
guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot
guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the
computer restarts.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important
troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incidentAlso,
an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely
force a computer shutdown.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they
have administrative privilegesThe user could then take ownership of any file, grant
themselves full control, and view or modify any fileThe fact that most removable storage
devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical button diminishes the advantage of this

Rationale:
It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on
their own workstationsHowever, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so
on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the
computer to become less stableA malicious user could install inappropriate printer
drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install
malicious software that masquerades as a printer driverIt is feasible for an attacker to
disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driverThe program may appear to users as if
they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your

Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple
bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a domain controller.
The recommended state for this setting is: Require signing.
Rationale:
Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacksIn such attacks, an
intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then
forwards them to the clientWhere LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a
client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directoryTo lower
the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong
physical security measures to protect the network infrastructureAlso, you could
implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which
performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of manin-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.

Description:
This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its
computer account passwordComputers that cannot automatically change their account
passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the
password for the system's domain account.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a
domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts
every 30 daysIf you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server
will retain the same passwords as their computer accountsComputers that are no longer
able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with domain
controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit)
session key.
To enable this policy setting, all domain controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt
secure channel data with a strong key, which means all domain controllers must be running
Microsoft Windows 2000 or later.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between domain
controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in
previous Microsoft operating systemsWhenever possible, you should take advantage of
these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel communications from attacks
that attempt to hijack network sessions and eavesdropping(Eavesdropping is a form of
hacking in which network data is read or altered in transitThe data can be modified to
hide or change the sender, or be redirected.)

 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the account name of the last user to log on to the
client computers in your organization will be displayed in each computer's respective
Windows logon screenEnable this policy setting to prevent intruders from collecting
account names visually from the screens of desktop or laptop computers in your
organization.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or
someone who is able to connect to the server through Terminal Services) could view the
name of the last user who logged on to the serverThe attacker could then try to guess the
password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log
on.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical
impairments to log on to computers that run WindowsIf users are not required to press
CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords.
If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of
a trusted path.
An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows
logon dialog box and capture the user's passwordThe attacker would then be able to log
on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

Rationale:
Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the
attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happensIt may also help to
reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the
logon processThis text is often used for legal reasons—for example, to warn users about
the ramifications of misusing company information or to warn them that their actions may
be audited.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using
cached account informationLogon information for domain accounts can be cached locally
to allow users to log on even if a domain controller cannot be contactedThis policy setting
determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locallyIf
this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabledAn attacker who is able to access
the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force
attack to determine user passwords.
The recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s).
Rationale:
The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose
logon information the computer will cache locallyIf the number is set to 4, then the
computer caches logon information for 4 usersWhen a 5th user logs on to the computer,
the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.
Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that
computerAn attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate
this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user
passwordsTo mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures
its physical location.

Description:
This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is
removed from the smart card reader.
The recommended state for this setting is: Lock WorkstationConfiguring this setting to
Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms
with the benchmark.
Rationale:
Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing
the possibility for malicious users to access their computersIf smart cards are used for
authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to
ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those
credentials.

prescribed, noting that values of Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop
Services session are also acceptable settingsThis group policy setting is backed by the
following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon:ScRemoveOption

Workstation (or, if applicable for your environment, Force Logoff or Disconnect if a
Remote Desktop Services session):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior


Impact:
If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed,
allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a
protected session.
If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is
removed.
If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart
card disconnects the session without logging the users offThis allows the user to insert the
smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped
computer, without having to log on againIf the session is local, this policy will function
identically to Lock Workstation.
Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers
in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivityFor example, if
network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several
computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting
will limit them to logging onto one computer at a timeFor these reasons it is
recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes
commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client
component.
Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they
connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is
synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign
communications (always), on those serversFor more information about these settings,
see the "Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related
settings)" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progressAttackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actionsAlternatively, the attacker
could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized
access to data.
SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating
systemsIt is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocolsSMB signatures authenticate
both users and the servers that host the dataIf either side fails the authentication process,

protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and
supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacksSMB signing
provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then
verified by both the client and the server.
Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet
needs to be signed and verifiedIf these settings are enabled on a server that is performing
multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed.
Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
applications and operating systems will not be able to connectHowever, if you completely
disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

password to third-party SMB servers' is set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the SMB redirector will send plaintext passwords
during authentication to third-party SMB servers that do not support password encryption.
It is recommended that you disable this policy setting unless there is a strong business case
to enable itIf this policy setting is enabled, unencrypted passwords will be allowed across
the network.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
If you enable this policy setting, the server can transmit passwords in plaintext across the
network to other computers that offer SMB services, which is a significant security risk.
These other computers may not use any of the SMB security mechanisms that are included
with Windows Server 2003.

This section contains recommendations related to configuring the Microsoft network
server.

2.3.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Amount of idle time
required before suspending session' is set to '15 or fewer minute(s), but
not 0' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must pass
in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivityAdministrators can
use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an inactive SMB sessionIf
client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished.
A value of 0 appears to allow sessions to persist indefinitelyThe maximum value is 99999,
which is over 69 days; in effect, this value disables the setting.
The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or fewer minute(s), but not 0.
Rationale:
Each SMB session consumes server resources, and numerous null sessions will slow the
server or possibly cause it to failAn attacker could repeatedly establish SMB sessions until
the server's SMB services become slow or unresponsive.
Audit:

validation level' is set to 'Accept if provided by client' or higher (MS only)
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the level of validation a computer with shared folders or
printers (the server) performs on the service principal name (SPN) that is provided by the
client computer when it establishes a session using the server message block (SMB)
protocol.
The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for file and print sharing and
other networking operations, such as remote Windows administrationThe SMB protocol
supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the authentication
blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against SMB servers referred to
as SMB relay attacksThis setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.
The recommended state for this setting is: Accept if provided by clientConfiguring
this setting to Required from client also conforms to the benchmark.
Rationale:
The identity of a computer can be spoofed to gain unauthorized access to network
resources.

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribedThis group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters:

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Accept if
provided by client (configuring to Required from client also conforms to the
benchmark):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network server: Server SPN target name
validation level

Impact:
All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a serverside SMB componentThis setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its implementation
should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent disruptions to file and print serving
capabilities.
If configured to Accept if provided by client, the SMB server will accept and validate
the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it matches the
SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itselfIf the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that
SMB client will be denied.
If configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session
setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to
establish a connectionIf no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match,
the session is denied.
Note: Since the release of the MS KB3161561 security patch, this setting can cause
significant issues (such as replication problems, group policy editing issues and blue screen
crashes) on domain controllers when used simultaneously with UNC path hardening (i.e.
rule 18.4.14.1)CIS therefore recommends against deploying this setting on domain
controllers.

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are
authenticatedThe Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including
the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resourceThe
Guest only option allows you to treat all users equallyIn this context, all users authenticate
as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.
The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as
themselves.
Note: This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using
such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services).
Rationale:
With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the
network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write
access to shared resources on that computerAlthough this restriction does increase
security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those
computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for
the Guest accountWith the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected.
Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared
system resources.

Description:
This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when
reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identityThis policy is supported
on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista
or Windows Server 2008, services running as Local System and using SPNEGO (Negotiate)
that revert to NTLM use the computer identityIn Windows 7, if you are connecting to a
computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system service uses
either the computer identity or a NULL sessionWhen connecting with a NULL session, a
system-generated session key is created, which provides no protection but allows
applications to sign and encrypt data without errorsWhen connecting with the computer
identity, both signing and encryption is supported in order to provide data protection.

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.
The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider
(SSP)The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows
media and file sharing feature called Homegroup, which permits sharing between
computers that are not members of a domain.
With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,
Spnego.dllIn previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos
or NTLM for authenticationThe extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is
treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including
PKU2U.
When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,
Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log onThe PKU2U SSP
obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computersWhen
validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer
for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process
completes.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be
managed centrally in most managed networks.

Description:
This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new
password is stored when the password is changedThe LM hash is relatively weak and
prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash.
Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can
then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.
Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy
setting is enabledAlso, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts
after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password
hashesSuch attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to
impersonate users and gain access to resources on your networkThese types of attacks

2.3.11.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication
level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response onlyRefuse LM & NTLM' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating
Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network.
LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features,
and network administration toolsIn Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is
the default authentication protocolHowever, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for
some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2LAN Manager authentication
includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is
used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:






Join a domain
Authenticate between Active Directory forests
Authenticate to down-level domains
Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
or Windows XP
Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain

The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which
challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logonsThis choice affects
the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated,
and the level of authentication accepted by servers.
The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response onlyRefuse LM &
NTLM.


Rationale:
Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM
authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send
LM)The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (nonR2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resourcesHowever, this
meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over
the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily
reproduce the user's password.
The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the
Kerberos version 5 protocol for authenticationFor this reason, in a Windows Server
domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for
network authenticationYou can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2For the logon process,
NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication processEven if you use
NTLMv2 for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with
Windows Server 2003 or higher domain controllersFor these reasons, it is strongly
preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribedThis group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa:LmCompatibilityLevel

NTLMv2 response onlyRefuse LM & NTLM:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network security: LAN Manager authentication level


Impact:
Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server
supports it; domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication).
Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the
domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.
Note: For information about a hotfix to ensure that this setting works in networks that
include Windows NT 4.0-based computers along with Windows 2000, Windows XP, and
Windows Server 2003-based computers, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 305379:
Authentication Problems in Windows 2000 with NTLM 2 Levels Above 2 in a Windows NT
4.0 Domain.
Default Value:
Send NTLMv2 response only(Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2
session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM & NTLMv2
authentication.)

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients
that issue LDAP BIND requests.
Note: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind
(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s)No
Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use
ldap_simple_bind or ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a domain controller.
The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signingConfiguring this setting to
Require signing also conforms with the benchmark.
Rationale:
Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder
captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them
to the serverFor an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a
server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queriesTo
lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to
protect the network infrastructureAlso, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle
attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means
of IPsec authentication headers.

Description:
This policy setting determines whether a computer can be shut down when a user is not
logged onIf this policy setting is enabled, the shutdown command is available on the
Windows logon screenIt is recommended to disable this policy setting to restrict the
ability to shut down the computer to users with credentials on the system.
The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledNote: In Server 2008 R2 and older

shut down or restart the server.
Rationale:
Users who can access the console locally could shut down the computerAttackers could
also walk to the local console and restart the server, which would cause a temporary DoS

2.3.15.1 (L1) Ensure 'System objects: Require case insensitivity for nonWindows subsystems' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems.
The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitiveHowever, the kernel supports case
sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX
(POSIX)Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case
sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX
subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label
itSuch a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32
tools, because only one of the files will be available.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity,
failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to
create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower
case lettersSuch a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such
files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will be available.

the Built-in Administrator account' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in
Administrator account.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is
trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without
the user or administrator being aware of its activityAn attack vector for these programs
was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user
account was created for all installations of WindowsTo address this risk, in Windows Vista
and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by defaultIn a default
installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are
initially set up in one of two ways: - If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user
account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator- If the
computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are createdThe Enterprise
or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local
administrator account is warranted.
Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled,
but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

Description:
This policy setting controls whether User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess or UIA)

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
One of the risks that the UAC feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is
that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or
administrator being aware of its activityThis setting allows the administrator to perform
operations that require elevated privileges while connected via Remote AssistanceThis
increases security in that organizations can use UAC even when end user support is
provided remotelyHowever, it also reduces security by adding the risk that an
administrator might allow an unprivileged user to share elevated privileges for an
application that the administrator needs to use during the Remote Desktop session.

this setting to reduce help desk calls.
Note: With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed
when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring privilege
elevation (without Administrator rights) is "This program will not runThis program is
blocked by group policyFor more information, contact your system administrator." Some
users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program
they attempted is specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message seems to
implyThis message may therefore result in user questions as to why that specific
operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to perform the
operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or "Run as Administrator" if
it is already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.
Default Value:

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface
Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system.
Secure locations are limited to the following: - …\Program Files\, including subfolders …\Windows\system32\ - …\Program Files (x86)\, including subfolders for 64-bit versions
of Windows
Note: Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any
interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the
state of this security setting.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI)
restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an
administratorThis is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that
are transmitting user interfaces to alternative formsA process that is started with
UIAccess rights has the following abilities: - To set the foreground window- To drive any
application window using SendInput function- To use read input for all integrity levels
using low-level hooks, raw input, GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInputTo set journal hooks- To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity

Description:
Select On (recommended) to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security use the
settings for this profile to filter network trafficIf you select Off, Windows Firewall with
Advanced Security will not use any of the firewall rules or connection security rules for this
profile.
The recommended state for this setting is: On (recommended).

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an
outbound firewall rule.
The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).
Note: If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using
a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy
updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work.
Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to
workEnsure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles
before deploying.
Rationale:
Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those
specifically approved by the user or administratorMicrosoft disagrees with this opinion,
blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of
dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser
or instant messaging softwareAdditionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value
because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
anyway.

Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive

The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes;
highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration
changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in
account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command)These
integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and
permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could
be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system
areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files
inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).

3.5 Use File Integrity Tools For Critical System Files
Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive
system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered.
The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes;
highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration
changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in
account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command)These
integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and
permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could
be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system
areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files
inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).

4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity checkIf this
problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being
modified in transit to this computerVerify that the packets sent from the remote
computer are the same as those received by this computerThis error might also
indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay checkIf this problem
persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay checkThe inbound
packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured.
This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without
informing this computerThis could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
Parameter Index (SPI)This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is
corrupting packetsIf these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the
remote computer are the same as those received by this computerThis error may
also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementationsIn that

This section contains recommendations for configuring Microsoft Local Administrator
Password Solution (LAPS).
The Group Policy settings contained within this section are provided by the Group Policy
template AdmPwd.admx/adml that is included with LAPS.

18.2.1 (L1) Ensure LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE is installed (MS
only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool,
which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set
randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached
workstations and member serversThe passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of
the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved
Sysadmins when needed.
The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as
well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.
Please see the LAPS documentation for details.
LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer
server OSesLAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a
domain.
Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique &
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.


Rationale:
Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or member servers when
deploying themThis poses a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker
manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator
account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers
that also use that password for their local Administrator account.
Audit:
The LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE can be verified to be installed by the presence of
the following registry value:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions\{D76B9641-3288-4f75-942D087DE603E3EA}:DllName

Remediation:
In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group
Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be installed on each managed computerWhen
LAPS is installed, the file AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and
registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for
you):
C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll

Impact:
No impactWhen installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless
given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refreshIt is not a memory-resident
agent or service.
In a disaster recovery scenario where Active Directory is not available, the local
Administrator password will not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool
(such as Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be
necessary.
Default Value:
Not Installed.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool,
which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set
randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached
workstations and member serversThe passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of
the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved
Sysadmins when needed.
The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as
well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.
Please see the LAPS documentation for details.
LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer
server OSesLAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a
domain.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Large letters + small letters +
numbers + special characters.
Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique &
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.
Rationale:
Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or member servers when
deploying themThis poses a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker
manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator
account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers
that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to
easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP
addresses that are configured on those systemsThis setting determines whether the
computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to
spoofingSpoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user
who performed the actionA malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the
protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the
computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.
An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its
NetBIOS nameAs with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that
you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production
environment.
The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target
computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET
SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

security event log at which the system will generate a warning' is set to
'Enabled: 90% or less' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This setting can generate a security audit in the Security event log when the log reaches a
user-defined threshold.
Note: If log settings are configured to Overwrite events as needed or Overwrite events
older than x days, this event will not be generated.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 90% or less.
Rationale:
If the Security log reaches 90 percent of its capacity and the computer has not been
configured to overwrite events as needed, more recent events will not be written to the log.
If the log reaches its capacity and the computer has been configured to shut down when it
can no longer record events to the Security log, the computer will shut down and will no

Parameter 'NodeType' is set to '0x2 (2)') (MS Only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This parameter determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) will use to
register and resolve names.





A B-node (broadcast) system only uses broadcasts.
A P-node (point-to-point) system uses only name queries to a name server (WINS).
An M-node (mixed) system broadcasts first, then queries the name server (WINS).
An H-node (hybrid) system queries the name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts.

The recommended state for this setting is: NodeType - 0x2 (2).


Rationale:
In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks,
setting the node type to P-node will prevent the system from sending out NetBIOS
broadcasts.
Audit:
Navigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0x2 (2)
(DWORD):

Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restartedNote #2:
Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a

Impact:
NetBIOS name resolution queries will require a defined and available WINS server for
external NetBIOS name resolutionIf a WINS server is not defined or not reachable, and the
desired hostname is not defined in the local cache, local LMHOSTS or HOSTS files, NetBIOS
name resolution will fail.

'Enabled' (MS Only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocolWith LLMNR, queries are sent using
multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another
client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabledLLMNR does not require
a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in
which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137)
broadcasts and respond to them, It can trick the host into thinking that it knows the
location of the requested system.
Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting,
the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP
(on the WINS tab in the NIC properties)Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve
this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per NIC setting that varies with different
NIC hardware installations.

shares.

Note: If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 or higher
systems, then the "Privacy" setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB encryption.
However, using SMB encryption will render the targeted share paths completely
inaccessible by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and thorough
testing.


Rationale:
In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk
in Group Policy as part of MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483This mechanism requires both the
installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy
settings to all computers on the domain from Vista/Server 2008 or higher (the associated
security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003)A new group policy
template (NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update.
Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to
remediate the Group Policy security risk: \\*\NETLOGON
RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 \\*\SYSVOL
RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the

 Level 2 - Domain Controller
 Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange
information over the Internet and over home and business networksIPv6 allows for many
more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 didOlder networking, hosts and operating
systems may not support IPv6 natively.
The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)
Rationale:
Since the vast majority of private corporate networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because
they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible
attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic onAs a result, we recommend
configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.

Enabling this setting allows an organization to use their enterprise user accounts instead of
using their Microsoft accounts when accessing Windows store appsThis provides the
organization with greater control over relevant credentialsMicrosoft accounts cannot be
centrally managed and as such enterprise credential security policies cannot be applied to
them, which could put any information accessed by using Microsoft accounts at risk.

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most
recent onesTo mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
method so that older events are overwritten as needed.
The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.
Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large
number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attackThese risks can be
somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
compromises a server could clear the Security logIf all events are sent to a monitoring
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

Description:
This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to
secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connectionsThis policy only applies when you are using
native RDP encryptionHowever, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is
not recommendedThis policy does not apply to SSL encryption.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: High Level.
Rationale:
If Terminal Server client connections are allowed that use low level encryption, it is more
likely that an attacker will be able to decrypt any captured Terminal Services network
traffic.

Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active
Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is automatically
disconnected.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less.
Rationale:
This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer
for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being
consumed by large numbers of inactive sessionsIn addition, old, forgotten Remote
Desktops session that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password
has changed but the old session is still runningFor systems that limit the number of
connected users (e.gservers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other
users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an
effective denial of service.

Description:
This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Microsoft-WindowsPowerShell/Operational event log.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: In Microsoft's own hardening guidance, they recommend the opposite value,
Enabled, because having this data logged improves investigations of PowerShell attack
incidentsHowever, the default ACL on the PowerShell Operational log allows Interactive
User (i.eany logged on user) to read it, and therefore possibly expose passwords or other
sensitive information to unauthorized usersIf Microsoft locks down the default ACL on
that log in the future (e.gto restrict it only to Administrators), then we will revisit this
recommendation in a future release.

Note: On Server 2012 (non-R2) and higher, due to design changes in the OS after Server
2008 R2, configuring this setting as prescribed will prevent the ability to add or remove
Roles and Features (even locally) via the GUIWe therefore recommend that the necessary
Roles and Features be installed prior to configuring this setting on a Level 2 server.
Alternatively, Roles and Features can still be added or removed using the PowerShell
commands Add-WindowsFeature or Remove-WindowsFeature in the Server Manager
module, even with this setting configured.

18.9.90.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Select when Feature Updates are received' is set
to 'Enabled: Current Branch for Business, 180 days' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines what type of feature updates to receive, and when.
The branch readiness level for each new Windows 10 feature update is initially considered
a "Current Branch" (CB) release, to be used by organizations for initial deploymentsOnce
Microsoft has verified the feature update should be considered for enterprise deployment,
it will be declared a branch readiness level of "Current Branch for Business" (CBB).
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Current Branch for Business,
days.
Note: If the "Allow Telemetry" policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.
Rationale:
Forcing new features without prior testing in your environment could cause software
incompatibilities as well as introducing new bugs into the operating systemIn a controlled
corporate environment, it is generally preferred to delay the feature updates until
thorough testing and a deployment plan is in placeThis recommendation delays the
automatic installation of new features as long as possible.

'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Domain Controller
 Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions
when it installs any program on the system.
Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration
foldersTo make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.
Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants
to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and foldersNote
that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group,
installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.
